    <h2>Isabella d'Este</h2>
    <p>In the Renaissance period, there were many important women who made significant contributions to society. One of these women was Isabella d'Este, who was an Italian Renaissance noblewoman. She was a noted patron of the arts, and her court at Ferrara was considered one of the most sophisticated in Italy.</p>
    <p>In this portrait, Leonardo da Vinci captures the regal and sophisticated Isabella d'Este in profile. The work is characterized by the artist's use of light and shadow to create a sense of depth and dimension. In this sketch, we see her high forehead, aquiline nose, and thin lips. She looks like a woman who knows her own mind and is used to getting her way. The sitter's striking features are highlighted against a dark background, lending an ethereal quality to the portrait. Isabella d'Este was one of the most powerful women of her time, and Leonardo's masterful depiction of her expresses both her strength and her femininity.</p>
