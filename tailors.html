            <p>The bodice of my costume is finished! I'm so pleased with how it looks. I decided to go for a gold embroidery design on the front, and I think it looks really beautiful. I also added some pearls around the neckline, which I think makes it look very elegant. I still need to make the sleeves, but I'm planning on doing that tomorrow. I'm also going to make a detachable "partlet" to wear over the bodice, which was a common garment in Elizabethan times. It's basically a piece of fabric that covers the neck and chest, and is often decorated with lace</p>

            <p>I wasn't able to work on my Queen Elizabeth costume yesterday because I had to go out, so today I'm feeling a bit behind schedule. I'm hoping to have the bodice finished by the end of the day, but we'll see how it goes! I'm using a pattern for the bodice, but I'm altering it slightly to make it more accurate to Elizabethan clothing. I'm also adding some details that I think will make it look more beautiful, like some delicate gold embroidery and some pearls around the neckline. I'm really looking forward to seeing how it turns out. Wish me luck!</p>

            <p>Today I finished the skirt of my Elizabeth I costume. It's a full skirt with an underskirt, made from red velvet and red silk. I used a pattern for the underskirt and drafted the overskirt myself. It was actually surprisingly easy to make - I just used a large piece of fabric and cut it into a huge circle, then gathered it onto the waistband of the underskirt. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out so far, although it does make me feel a bit like a Christmas tree! I still need to make the bodice, which will be a lot more challenging, but I'm feeling pretty confident about it. I'm also planning on making a detachable "partlet" to wear over the bodice, which was a common garment in Elizabethan times. It's basically a piece of fabric that covers the neck and chest, and is often decorated with lace or embroidery. I've found a beautiful piece of lace on the internet that I think will be perfect. I can't wait to get started on it!</p>

            <p>After (what feels like) so many years of procrastination I'm finally starting work on my dream cosplay today. There are many important women from the Renaissance period, but one of the most significant is undoubtedly Queen Elizabeth I. She's one of my most inspirational historical figures and I've been waiting to get my costume making skills up to scratch before I even attempted her look. When it comes to constructing a costume to play her in a historical re-enactment, there are a few key elements to bear in mind. Firstly, her clothes would have been very elaborate, with rich fabrics and lots of jewelry. Secondly, her hair would have been styled in the famous "Elizabethan" style, with a curled fringe and pinned-up curls. To start the process I drew up some research and bought some luxurious, expensive fabrics - otherworldly red velvet and silks, decorated with pearls and lace. I also treated myself to an authentic Elizabethan corset from the internet. It's stiff and not very comfortable yet, but with some more lacing practice hopefully I'll get there! All in all, I'm feeling pretty inspired and can't wait to see the final result. What's your dream cosplay outfit?</p>

            <p>Today, I finished the final touches on the costume. I put my hair up in a 15th century style using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawYY-P8AQI&ab_channel=Zabrena" target="_blank">this linked tutorial</a>, and did my makeup using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iquQBqD2Gs4&ab_channel=EnglishHeritage" target="_blank">this linked tutorial</a>.</p>
            <p>I'm really happy with how the costume turned out, and I can't wait to wear it to the festival next weekend!</p>
            <h3>12/04/2018 1:25am</h3>
            <p>Today, I finished the slippers. I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkfEZd14to&ab_channel=DSAThreadsCostuming" target="_blank">this linked tutorial</a>, and they turned out quite well, if I do say so myself.</p>
            <p>I also made a small purse to hold my phone and other essentials, using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHeI8T6mKGs&ab_channel=scarboroughwear" target="_blank">this linked tutorial.</a></p>
            <h3>11/04/2018 4:21pm</h3>
            <p>After all the drama (and if we're being honest, sexism) that went down with the uni's Historia Normannis society last semester, some of the girls from the group and I have decided to do our own thing for the Medieval Festival in Herstmonceux Castle next weekend. We've all chosen an important woman from the Renaissance period to cosplay as. I have chosen Isabella d'Este, an Italian noblewoman, and so I have been busy constructing a costume to wear. I started by doing some research, both in the library and online, and put together a Pinterest board as useful inspiration.</p>
            <p>I bought some ivory fabric for the persephone sleeveless gown, some beige fabric for the undergarments, and dyed them dark blue using fabric dye in my dorm bathroom. The pictures are of the finished garment below.</p>
            <p>Next, I started on the overgown. I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo4twUjrLV0&ab_channel=sew_through_time" target="_blank">this linked tutorial</a> to do the basic pattern.</p>
            <p>Finally, I'll be sewing the belt. Using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If86K89S3Ec&t=382s&ab_channel=CorterLeather" target="_blank">this linked tutorial</a>, I cut a long strip of beige leather for the belt, with a hole for a dagger in the centre. The leather should have a sheepskin lining to avoid it slipping down the dress.</p>
            <p>I'll be making the slippers from scratch as well, but I'm still working on the pattern for those.</p>
