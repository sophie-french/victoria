    <h3>
        Hang on... you've found a hidden corridor</h3>
    <h3>You stand in front of a mysterious secret passageway that's been flooding with water lately. It's unclear what's causing the water to flood the passageway, but it appears to be getting worse. At the end of the passage you can see a door faintly aglow with light. You're not sure what's on the other side, but you know you need to find out.</h3>
