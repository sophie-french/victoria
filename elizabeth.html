    <h2>Queen Elizabeth I</h2>
    <p>There are many important women from the Renaissance period, but one of the most significant is undoubtedly Queen Elizabeth I. Born in 1533, she ascended to the throne in 1558 and went on to rule for over 40 years, overseeing a period of great prosperity and achievement in England.</p>
    <p>The <i>"Darnley Portrait"</i> of Elizabeth I of England by Johannes Corvus was painted in 1575, and is one of the most iconic and well-known portraits of the Queen. It depicts Elizabeth in a lavish dress and jewellery, with a large ermine-trimmed cloak draped over her shoulders. Her red hair is worn in a famous style known as the "Darnley Knot", and she stares directly out at the viewer with a piercing gaze. The portrait is named after Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was Elizabeth's second husband, and it is said to be an accurate likeness of the Queen.</p>
